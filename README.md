# Alien Escape Game

Welcome to Alien Escape, a turn-by-turn strategy game where you play as a character who wakes up in a dark room in an unknown building. Your goal is to find a torch, battle the aliens that are trying to capture you, and escape the building.

## Getting Started

To play the game, simply run the executable file on your computer. Once the game has loaded, you will be presented with a screen that allows you to select your difficulty level and character.

## Gameplay

The game is divided into turns, during which you can move your character, explore the building, and battle aliens. You will start the game in a dark room with no light, so your first objective is to find a torch to illuminate your path.

As you move through the building, you will encounter a variety of alien species, each with their own unique strengths and weaknesses. To battle the aliens, you must use a combination of strategy and quick reflexes to dodge attacks and deliver counter-attacks.

Throughout the game, you will also encounter various obstacles, such as locked doors and hidden passages, that will require you to use your wits to overcome.
