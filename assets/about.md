# About the Project

## Inspiration

The inspiration behind the Alien Escape game was the classic sci-fi theme of battling aliens to save humanity. We wanted to create a Pokemon style turn-based strategy game that combined elements of exploration, combat, and survival. Our goal was to create a game that was fun to play and challenging enough to keep players engaged for hours.

## What We Learned

During the development of Alien Escape, we learned a lot about game design, programming, and problem-solving. We had to come up with creative solutions to design challenges, such as creating different alien species (which we didn't get round to implementing), implementing turn-based gameplay, and balancing the difficulty of the game (still a work-in-progress). We also learned about the importance of user feedback and playtesting to improve the game's quality and user experience.

## Building the Project

To build Alien Escape, we used Python as the primary programming language and Pygame as the game development framework. We started by creating the game's basic mechanics, such as movement, combat, and exploration. We added the game's graphics, sound effects, and music to enhance the overall experience. Finally, we plan to add features such as enemy AI, game levels, and power-ups to make the game more challenging and engaging.

## Challenges Faced

Developing Alien Escape wasn't without its challenges. Here are some of the challenges we faced:

- A team member fell ill and was no longer able to help early on, which added more strain on the team
- The team, more of a duo, was across multiple time zones (mostly the US and India) along with technology issues like internet connectivity, power outages, microphones, and accents meant we had to be creative in communication - which we excelled at.
- We bit off more than we could chew. We thought we could boil the ocean when we could only boil a pot of water.

Despite these challenges, we were able to overcome them and create a game that we are proud of.
